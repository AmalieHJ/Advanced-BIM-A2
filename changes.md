# Advanced-BIM-A2

##Process of Assignment 2
First the zip-file was forked from Tim's github account. 
We ran the codes on our macihne and tried to understand the different outputs and connections between the html script, java script and index.html file. 

Instead of making changes directly in the index.html file, we focused on making changes in the html-build python file so we could use the code later on in our use case project.

In regards to our chosen use case on LCA, the target was to calculate the number of windows on each level in the buiding.

Result:
We managed to get the correct output of windows per level in the HTMLBuild python code, but didn't manage to get the correct output displayed for all levels in the index.html file due to lack of correct code in the java script (html-buil.js).
Notice that only the number of windows on Level 1 are displayed in the viewport when clicking on a floor in the index.html file.
This are future work.
